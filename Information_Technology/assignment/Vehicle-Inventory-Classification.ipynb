    "*Maybe the LeNet is still no the best choice for our task. Actually, most of the time, when solving image classification problems, the best results are achieved using pre-built CNN architecture pre-trained on imagenet dataset. This process is commonly known as **transfer learning** or **fine-tuning**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*ResNet50, is a much deeper CNN that was developed to tackle the problem of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks. ResNet50 is made up of many layers that are organized into blocks, each of which has a set of convolutional layers followed by shortcut connections that allow for the easy flow of information between layers. These shortcut connections help to prevent vanishing gradients and allow the network to learn very deep representations of the input images. This makes ResNet50 ideal for image classification tasks where the input images are complex and large.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Therefore, it would be better to use ResNet50 finetuning for image classification tasks, especially if the input images are complex and large, as it has been optimized for this specific task and has shown to be very effective in achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, using ResNet50 finetuning means that the model can take advantage of the pre-trained weights on a large dataset, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance on smaller datasets.*\n",

Try with more epochs and also adding [callbacks](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/) for saving the best weights (`ModelCheckpoint`), storing training logs (`TensorBoard` or `CSVLogger`), changing learning rate during training depending on the improvements in the loss function (`ReduceLROnPlateau`), etc.\n",

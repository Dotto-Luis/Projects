## 1. Business Goal

This project is related to NLP. As you may already know, the most important and hardest part of an NLP project is pre-processing, which is why I am going to focus on that.

Basically this is a basic sentiment analysis problem, as in this case, consists of a classification problem, where the possible output labels are: `positive` and `negative`. Which indicates, if the review of a movie speaks positively or negatively. In our case it is a binary problem, but one could have many more "feelings" tagged and thus allow a more granular analysis.

## 2. About the data

In this project, I will work exclusively with two files: `movies_review_train_aai.csv` and `movies_review_test_aai.csv`.


This is a dataset for **binary sentiment classification**.

## 3. Usage Examples

Run the full notebook end-to-end:

```bash
jupyter notebook SentimentClassifier-MovieReviews.ipynb
```

Or use the `src` modules directly:

```python
from src.extract import load_data
from src.transform import preprocess_text
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data
train_df = load_data("datasets/movies_review_train_aai.csv")

# Preprocess — tokenize, remove stopwords, stem/lemmatize
train_df["clean_text"] = train_df["review"].apply(preprocess_text)

# Train classifier
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, train_df["label"])
```

Example prediction:

```python
review = "An absolute masterpiece. The storytelling was breathtaking."
# → positive

review = "Complete waste of time. Terrible acting and boring plot."
# → negative
```

```

Here is the list of required packages:

## 6. Tests

I've added some basic tests to `SentimentClassifier-MovieReviews` that you must be able to run without errors in order to approve the project. If you encounter some issues in the path, make sure to be following these requirements in your code:

- Every time you need to run a tokenizer on your sentences, use `nltk.tokenize.toktok.ToktokTokenizer`.
- When removing stopwords, always use `nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')`.
- For Stemming, use `nltk.porter.PorterStemmer`.
- For Lematizer, use `Spacy` pre-trained model `en_core_web_sm`.

I provide unit tests along with the project that you can run and check from your side the code meets the minimum requirements of correctness needed to approve. To run just execute:

```console
$ pytest tests/
```

    #     datasets.

    # 3. TODO Impute values for all columns with missing data or, just all the columns.

    #     model to transform all the datasets.

    # 4. TODO Feature scaling with Min-Max scaler. Apply this to all the columns.
    # Please use sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler().
    # Again, take into account that:

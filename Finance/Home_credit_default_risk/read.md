## Business Goal

This is a binary Classification task: we want to predict whether the person applying for a home credit will be able to repay their debt or not. Our model will have to predict a 1 indicating the client will have payment difficulties: he/she will have late payment of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in our sample, 0 in all other cases.

We will use Area Under the ROC Curve as the evaluation metric, so our models will have to return the probabilities that a loan is not paid for each input data.

## About the data

The original dataset is composed of multiple files with different information about loans taken. In this project, we will work exclusively with the primary files: application_train_aai.csv and application_test_aai.csv.

You don't have to worry about downloading the data, it will be automatically downloaded from the AnyoneAI - Sprint Project 02.ipynb notebook in Section 1 - Getting the data.

These data comes from a project in Kaggle, and a Home Credit Compay calle Home Credit(https://www.homecredit.net/)

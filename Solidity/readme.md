# 👋 Introducing `Smart Contracts`
- [What is a Smart Contract?](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

## 🔍 Cryptography
- [What is a SHA-256](https://academy.bit2me.com/sha256-algoritmo-bitcoin/)
- [HASH](https://academy.bit2me.com/que-es-hash/)
- [NONCE?](https://academy.bit2me.com/que-es-nonce/)

# 🏗️ 🔨 Built With
- [SOLIDITY](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/#): Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). There are many other blockchains (other than Ethereum) that are EVM compatible. If you’re interested to learn more I recommend reading the Introduction to Smart Contracts section in the Solidity docs.
